                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    In 2022, I worked at a packaging company facing a perfect storm—inventory levels kept climbing, conversion rates stayed stagnant, and customer complaints flooded in like spam emails after signing up for a "free" trial. Management, in a classic move, looked at the marketing team and said, "Fix it." No roadmap, no specifics, just a desperate hope that we’d pull a rabbit out of a hat. My task? Design, define, carry out, and implement a structured feedback system to figure out where things were going wrong.

                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    The goal was clear: gather meaningful customer insights, improve the buying experience, and ultimately increase conversions. I needed to build a system that collected real, actionable feedback, not just the usual "Your call is very important to us" nonsense. The challenge? Marketing wasn’t exactly equipped for deep customer research, and securing team buy-in for major changes was like convincing a cat to take a bath.

                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    I went all in—launched website widgets, live chat, improved contact forms, boosted customer service calls, gathered on-site feedback, monitored Google reviews, implemented email follow-ups, and even brought in a third-party consultant. Five months of blood, sweat, and customer complaints later, the consultant proved to be the game-changer. I met with them, asked the hard questions, got buy-in from leadership, and we revamped everything: website copy, UI/UX, product recommendations—basically gave our digital presence a full-blown makeover.

                    The impact? A 70% increase in conversion rates post-implementation. Customers found what they needed faster, complaints dropped, and suddenly, inventory wasn’t a problem—it was a necessity. The biggest takeaway? We made consulting an annual process because flying blind on customer experience is just asking for trouble. Moral of the story: when your customers are talking, listen—before they start shouting.
