                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    A few years ago, I joined a lighting company that had all the traffic in the world but almost nothing to show for it. People clicked on our ads, browsed the site, even added products to their carts—but then disappeared like they’d seen a ghost. The bounce rate was sitting at a painful 70%, conversion was a dismal 1.1%, and, strangely enough, even some placed orders weren’t translating into actual payments. It was like running a restaurant where people came in, ordered a full meal, and then just walked out before the food arrived. Clearly, something was broken, but what?                    <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
            <div class="icon-placeholder">
                <img src="image/2.png" alt="Icon 2" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Tasks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    To crack the case, we went full detective mode. We started with an in-depth marketing research phase, poring over heatmaps, session recordings, and customer feedback like it was an FBI investigation. Even with all that, we knew we needed fresh eyes, so we brought in a third-party CRO expert to confirm our suspicions. The problem wasn’t just one glaring mistake—it was death by a thousand cuts. The ad messaging didn’t always match the landing page, the product pages weren’t convincing enough, the checkout process felt like an interrogation, and post-purchase engagement was non-existent. That’s when we developed a five-phase framework to fix every single point of friction in the customer journey.            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    First, we cleaned up our ads and landing pages, making sure they spoke the same language and actually reassured visitors they were in the right place. Then, we tackled the product pages, rewriting descriptions, upgrading images, and adding reviews that felt real rather than written by a marketing intern on a caffeine binge. Once we got them to click ‘Add to Cart,’ we made sure they didn’t regret it—simplifying checkout, reducing form fields, and making the whole process feel effortless. And it didn’t stop there. We optimized our post-purchase email flows, ensuring customers didn’t just buy once but came back for more, building long-term relationships instead of one-and-done transactions. Every little tweak added up, and soon, the funnel that once leaked like a sinking ship started holding water.                <img src="image/4.png" alt="Icon 4" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">

                    The results spoke for themselves. The conversion rate jumped from 1.1% to 3.5%, which for a B2B business, is like going from “barely surviving” to “printing money.” More importantly, we proved that fixing the customer journey is often more profitable than just spending more on ads. Every business wants more traffic, but the real magic happens when you make the most of the visitors you already have. This project was a game-changer, not just for the company but for how I approach marketing in general. It’s not always about bringing in more people—it’s about making sure the right ones stay, buy, and come back for more.</div>
