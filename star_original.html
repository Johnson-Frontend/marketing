                    When I joined a food packaging company a few years ago, we kicked off a marketing research project—good ol’ primary research, survey-based, straight from the source. One question asked, "How do you place orders?" Turns out, 11% of our customers relied on catalogs. Not just preferred them—needed them. Why? Because logging into a website or app was about as appealing to them as assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. Trust issues, tech struggles, and password fatigue made online ordering a no-go. Clearly, we had to meet them where they were—on paper.

                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    The mission was clear: craft a catalog that was functional, not a doorstop. Think Uline, but without the unnecessary bulk—eco-friendly, practical, and actually enjoyable to flip through. This meant designing both digital and physical versions that included everything a buyer could need: product collections, SKUs, images, order forms, QR codes, contact info—you name it. If they wanted to place an order using pen and paper like it was 1995, we made sure they could.            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    Cue the meetings. A lot of meetings. Copywriting, graphic design, purchasing, management—everyone had a say in the catalog's destiny. We debated layouts, brand storytelling, the perfect shade of green for the eco-friendly vibes. Every detail mattered: product images, packaging sizes, even an attached order form for maximum convenience. The goal? Make ordering stupidly easy, whether someone preferred scanning a QR code or mailing in their form like an old-school magazine subscription.            <div class="icon-placeholder">

                    The digital catalog saw around 25 downloads per month (not breaking the internet, but still solid). Meanwhile, we printed and shipped over 3,000 hard copies to existing customers and walk-ins. Sales? They definitely jumped post-launch, though tracking direct attribution was tricky. But hey—if the register rings louder after the catalogs go out, we’ll take that as a win. Lesson learned? Sometimes, the simplest, most old-school solutions still work. Not everything needs an app.    </main>
