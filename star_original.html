                                There was one time at my previous company when we found ourselves in a tough spot. Sales were dragging, and I mean dragging. Our customer retention rate? A sad little 40%. To make it worse, the industry benchmark was 50%, so we were basically the kid at the back of the pack wheezing in gym class. And don’t even get me started on new customer growth—it was slower than traffic on a Friday evening. Something had to change, and fast, because letting our competitors lap us wasn’t an option.

                                The mission was clear: turn things around. We needed to get that retention rate up to at least 50% (but let’s be real, we wanted to blow past it), grow our email list, and start pulling in new customers on the regular. To get there, we mapped out the game plan: segment the audience (because one-size-fits-all emails are soooo 2005), switch to a better email provider (hello, Klaviyo), set up automated flows, and geek out over A/B testing subject lines until we found winners. Simple, right? (Spoiler: it wasn’t.)

                                First, we got serious about segmentation—breaking customers down by what they bought and where they were shopping. Then came the big upgrade: moving to Klaviyo. It was like trading a tricycle for a Tesla; the automation tools alone made me wonder why we hadn’t done this sooner. We built out email flows for everything—abandoned carts, win-back campaigns, post-purchase follow-ups. You name it, we automated it. And because I’m a sucker for data, we spent a year A/B testing subject lines to figure out what actually got people to click. Not gonna lie, the early days were rough—unsubscribe rates were high, and open rates were just meh. But we kept at it, fine-tuning as we went.

                        <div class="icon-placeholder">

                            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                                And it all paid off. Retention shot up from 40% to 65%, which was not only above the industry benchmark but also a big win for our bottom line. We started pulling in 20–30 new email subscribers a day and racking up over 200 new customers every month. Even our place order rate hit 1%, which was a solid improvement. Sure, open rates stuck around the industry average, but we learned a ton about what works (and what doesn’t). The biggest takeaway? Email campaigns work best when they’re part of a bigger marketing plan. Moving forward, we’d double down on automation and segmentation to make every email feel like it’s written just for the recipient.
