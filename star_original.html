                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    A few years ago, when I was working with a jewelry company, we handed over our Google Ads to a third-party agency, thinking they'd sprinkle some digital magic on our campaigns. To their credit, the traffic came in, but sales? Meh. Even when we threw more money at it, the results barely budged. It was like filling a leaky bucket—frustrating and expensive. Eventually, we had an epiphany: "Why are we paying someone else to get mediocre results when we can do that ourselves… or, you know, better?" So, we took back control.            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Tasks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    I was tasked with setting up 18 separate campaigns, each tailored to specific product categories and geographies. We weren’t just throwing ads into the void—we had a clear goal: a 10:1 return on ad spend (ROAS), meaning every dollar spent should bring in ten bucks in conversion value. Realistically, after factoring in costs, we expected around 8:1, but hey, that still beats whatever we were getting before. The plan was ambitious, but if you're going to bet on anyone, it might as well be yourself, right?                    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    We rolled up our sleeves and got to work. We didn’t just launch ads—we engineered them. Every campaign had custom ad copies, tailored headlines, strong calls-to-action, and a mix of image and video assets. We optimized aggressively, tracking metrics down to the SKU level. Clicks, impressions, CTR, ROAS—you name it, we monitored it. It wasn’t a "set it and forget it" deal; this was a daily fine-tuning operation. Some campaigns thrived, some flopped, but the beauty of running things in-house is that we could pivot fast.            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">

                    And the results? Let’s just say, we weren’t crazy to take the reins. ROAS shot up to 12:1, even after increasing the budget by 20%. Impressions nearly doubled, and the best-performing campaigns ended up contributing 80% of total traffic. We even spun off a new campaign based on our best-sellers because, well, why stop when you're ahead? What started as a "fine, we’ll do it ourselves" moment turned into one of the most profitable marketing moves we made.
