                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    When I first joined my previous company, I was handed a challenge wrapped in a "strategic and visionary" bow—put together an annual marketing budget plan. Sounds fun, right? Except, this was my first time crafting a full-year budget at the very start of the year. But hey, I love a good challenge. Let’s be real—marketing without money is like trying to win a Formula 1 race on a bicycle. Can we still do something? Sure. But it takes time, and time is the one thing more expensive than a Super Bowl ad slot.                <img src="image/2.png" alt="Icon 2" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Tasks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    The mission? Build a complete, foolproof marketing budget plan in two weeks. That meant squeezing everything—SEO, paid ads, email marketing, PR, collaborations, client gifts, greeting cards, website optimization, new apps, content marketing, and blogging—into a single proposal. Basically, every marketing tactic known to humankind had to be considered, prioritized, and budgeted. Oh, and it had to be convincing enough to unlock the sacred company funds. No pressure.                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    I spent those two weeks mapping everything into a campaign calendar, setting crystal-clear objectives and KPIs to support the proposal. Numbers were flying everywhere—$10,000 in budget, $100,000 in additional sales, 3,000 new customers, 4.9% conversion rate, 5,000 new subscribers. Of course, these weren’t numbers I pulled out of thin air; they came from rigorous internal and external research. The result? A proposal so data-driven and structured that it was practically un-arguable. Even the finance team had to nod in approval.

                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">

                    We set out to double our sales, and not only did we hit the target—we exceeded it with 108% growth. The best part? Everything was executed systematically, so no last-minute panics or “oh no, we forgot about X” moments. Work was smooth, stress levels were low, and when bonus time rolled around, let’s just say it felt heavier than last year. Turns out, when you mix strategy with data and sprinkle in a little negotiation magic, you don’t just get a budget—you get results.</div>
