                    When I joined the company, things were... let’s just say, uninspiring. New customer growth was moving at a snail’s pace, conversion rates were sadder than my abandoned gym membership, and email marketing was about as effective as yelling into the void. Sales? Stagnant. It was clear that we needed something to shake things up—something that didn’t just bring customers in but kept them coming back. Enter: my grand CRM vision, centered around rewards. Because let’s be real—who doesn’t love free stuff?
                    
                    <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
            <div class="icon-placeholder">
                <img src="image/2.png" alt="Icon 2" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Tasks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    I pitched the idea of integrating Yotpo, tying it seamlessly into our email marketing and website experience. The goal? Make customers feel like royalty every time they interacted with us. This meant setting up a rewards system that made every dollar spent feel like a step closer to something awesome. But a fancy tool alone doesn’t fix the problem. We had to design an irresistible system—one that made customers say, “Oh dang, I need to shop here again.”                <img src="image/3.png" alt="Icon 3" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    We structured the rewards to make every interaction feel like a win. $1 spent? 10 points. 100 points= $2 back. Account creation? 10 points. Leaving a review? Another 10. Birthday purchases? Double the points, because why not make birthdays extra sweet? We made sure customers saw their points—on the checkout page, in emails, in a dedicated rewards center. Visibility was key. If people knew they were close to a reward, they’d push to get there. Before long, those little “points” were driving serious purchases.        <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
            <div class="icon-placeholder">
                <img src="image/4.png" alt="Icon 4" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">

            <div class="text-content">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">

                    Within three months, conversion rates jumped from 3.2% to 5.9%—a nearly 85% increase. Loyalty engagement shot up, customers were racking up points like they were playing a video game, and suddenly, email marketing wasn’t just a money pit. The only thing left to do now? Feed the machine. More leads, more customers, more orders. Because if a solid CRM strategy can do this much, imagine what happens when we turn up the volume. 🚀        </div>
