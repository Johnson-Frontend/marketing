                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    When I joined a foodservice company a few years back, I quickly realized that the entire conversation—internally and externally—revolved around price. Customers wanted lower prices, sales reps pushed for discounts, and the whole place sounded like a flea market. For a marketer, that’s like nails on a chalkboard. If all people care about is price, it means marketing either isn’t doing its job or doesn’t exist. And I wasn’t about to let that slide.                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Tasks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    The goal was clear: escape the price war, build customer loyalty, and make sure our marketing efforts actually contributed to business performance. That meant positioning ourselves properly—because if you look at a business model canvas, everything above revenue and cost structure is just fancy talk for “why should anyone care about you?” Who we are, what we do, how we’re different, and why people should buy from us instead of the guy next door—these were questions we needed to answer, convincingly.                      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Actions</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                    So, we went all in. We tackled the 7Ps of marketing, overhauled our logo, revamped our color scheme, redefined our vision, mission, and slogan, and crafted a compelling brand story. We fine-tuned our product offerings, pricing strategy, distribution channels, promotional tactics, product copy, and even our imagery. We even went as far as internal training—because if our own team wasn’t sold on who we were, how could we expect customers to be? It was like giving the entire company a personality transplant, minus the medical bills.                <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">

                    And guess what? It worked. Sure, we still ran storewide discounts—20% or 25% off for Black Friday, because, well, capitalism—but when we didn’t? Customers still came and bought. The obsession with pricing started to fade (except for the sales team, but let’s be honest, their job is to push for easy wins). We weren’t best friends with them, but that’s fine—marketers and salespeople have different goals. At the end of the day, we got what we wanted: a brand that wasn’t just about being the cheapest option, but the best choice.
