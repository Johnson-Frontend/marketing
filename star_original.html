                                A few years ago, I managed social media for a 3D printer company. While our accounts were doing okay, management wanted to take things to the next level after seeing competitors drive significant traffic to their shopping sites through social media. The goal was clear: replicate that success while setting our brand apart.

                                We aimed to boost metrics across the board, including page likes, followers, post engagement, and views. Specific targets included 1,000 views and 50 likes per post, with a stretch goal of 90,000 subscribers within three months. To make it happen, we planned strategic activities like giveaways, live streams, and tutorials while maintaining a consistent posting routine.

                                We proposed a well-rounded strategy, including a 3D printer giveaway, bi-weekly live streams, YouTube tutorials, and engaging company introduction posts. Despite challenges like department silos and technical customer complaints, we stayed adaptable. To address user concerns, we invited technical experts to live FAQ sessions, which proved to be a hit. Our team worked cohesively and strategically to meet ambitious goals within tight deadlines.

                                Within three months, we achieved most of our goals, with one social media post going viral and racking up 1 million views. Engagement and followers grew significantly, and the FAQ sessions gained immense popularity, boosting the brandâ€™s reputation. From this experience, I learned that collaboration, avoiding silos, and strong leadership support are key to driving successful campaigns.
