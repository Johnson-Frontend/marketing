                                Two years ago, when I was with a food packaging company, we realized something alarming: we were running a business but flying blind. We had no clue how users felt about our experience, which products they actually wanted, or even where the heck they were coming from. Were they just stumbling onto our site by accident? Was our pricing a deal-breaker? And did people even associate our brand with something good—or just with that one time their order got lost? We needed answers. Desperately.                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Feature Item 2 -->
                    <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
                        <div class="icon-placeholder">
                            <img src="image/2.png" alt="Icon 2" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full">
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-content">

                            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                                Our goal was simple: get 100 solid responses out of a 6,000-person email list. We had pre-designed questions, hoping to uncover insights that would finally make sense of our business. Why were customers here? What did they expect? And most importantly—was our pricing making them cry inside?                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Feature Item 3 -->
                    <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
                        <div class="icon-placeholder">

                            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                                We went all in: email campaigns, snappy copy, eye-catching graphics, and of course, a reward (because let’s be real, nobody fills out surveys just for fun). We used Google Forms because, well, budgets exist. The survey went out, and then we waited. And refreshed our inbox. And waited some more.                        </div>

                    <!-- Feature Item 4 -->
                    <div class="content gradient-border flex items-center feature-item">
                        <div class="icon-placeholder">

                            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                                We got 89 legit responses—just shy of 100, but enough to work with. Turns out, customers wanted better touchpoints, clearer warehouse signage (so it didn’t feel like an abandoned factory), more email updates, and a stronger product lineup. They saw us as affordable, diverse, and a bakery packaging powerhouse—so at least we had that going for us. We made real changes, from improving communication to refining our product offerings based on actual demand, not just vibes. Moral of the story? Don’t assume—ask. And if needed, bribe them a little.
