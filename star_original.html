                                Our business was stuck in a traffic drought, with only 200 visitors per month trickling in. Conversion rates were crawling at 1.89%, and our domain authority score was sitting embarrassingly low at 8 out of 100. It was clear we needed to get serious about driving organic traffic. The big decision? SEO over ads, focusing on on-page SEO and external backlink building.

                                We set realistic yet ambitious goals. First, we aimed to build 3-5 high-quality backlinks each month from sites with authority scores between 10 and 60, ensuring relevance to our industry. Second, we targeted more than 400 organic visitors per month within one year. Lastly, improving our domain authority was a must—a gradual climb, but necessary to enhance rankings and visibility.

                                We kicked things off with a site audit and keyword research, digging into every nook and cranny of our website. A backlink audit followed, revealing our weaknesses, and competitor research helped us map out a battle plan. Then came execution: four optimized blogs per month, designed to rank for key terms and drive value. For backlinks, we tapped into outreach strategies—guest blogging, broken link building, and collaborating with relevant sites in our niche.

                                Within a year, we exceeded our organic traffic goal with 420 daily visitors, complemented by an additional 400 from ads. Our domain authority saw a significant jump from 8 to 18 over 16 months. Most exciting? Our conversion rate soared from 1.89% to 4.5% on average. <br> 
                                Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is SEO. Consistency and patience are key. Having a structured approach, almost like a project management framework, ensured we stayed focused and productive. Whether it was link-building outreach or on-page optimization, working methodically made all the difference.
